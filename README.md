# GoTrainer

This is a small web app I created in Sveltekit, using Tailwind CSS and MongoDB to help study opening sequences and mistakes one made in Games with a spaced repetition system. I found that this doesn't work particularly well using classical flashcards and programs such as Anki, since there can be multiple good moves in a given position, and a good move sometimes needs to be followed up by further good moves to make it truly correct (even a blind squirrel sometimes finds a nut).

###Milestones:

1. Upload sequences of moves to be stored in the database in named Decks
2. Study specific Decks with one move questions using spaced repetition

###Future Goals:

1. More different question types
2. Proper login and registration system
3. Interface to upload moves on the website (currently only possible with Go Program installed on ones computer)
